PROFESSOR,

I COMPLETED THIS ASSIGNMENT WELL BEFORE THE DEADLINE (I finished Section6 Thursday, October 9th, at around 7:40pm [had to dig through the previous mod details for the file]). OUT OF PURE STUPIDITY AND MISREMEMBRANCE,
I FORGOT TO UPLOAD EVERYTHING TO GITHUB UNTIL EARLIER THIS EVENING (October 12th). THIS IS WHY MY SECTION 6 EVIDENCE IS PAST MIDNIGHT (by 19 seconds). I APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY, AND I HOPE THAT THE EVIDENCE
BEING AFTER MIDNIGHT (by 19 seconds) IS NOT A HUGE DEAL. PLEASE CONTACT ME AT MY EMAIL (antakidx@mail.uc.edu) IF YOU WOULD LIKE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MY FAILURE TO UPLOAD THE EVIDENCE BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

KIND REGARDS,
DOMINIC ANTAKI.
