PROFESSOR,

I COMPLETED THIS ASSIGNMENT WELL BEFORE THE DEADLINE (I finished Section6 Thursday, October 9th, at around 7:40pm). OUT OF PURE STUPIDITY AND MISREMEMBRANCE, I FORGOT TO RUN THE UNIT TESTS AND TAKE PICTURES,
AS WELL AS UPLOAD EVERYTHING TO GITHUB UNTIL VERY LATE THIS EVENING (October 12th). THIS IS WHY MY SECTION6 EVIDENCE IS PAST MIDNIGHT (by 19 seconds). I APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY, AND I HOPE THAT THE EVIDENCE BEING
AFTER MIDNIGHT (by 19 seconds) IS NOT A HUGE DEAL. PLEASE CONTACT ME AT MY EMAIL (antakidx@mail.uc.edu) IF YOU WOULD LIKE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MY FAILURE TO UPLOAD BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

KIND REGARDS,
DOMINIC ANTAKI.
